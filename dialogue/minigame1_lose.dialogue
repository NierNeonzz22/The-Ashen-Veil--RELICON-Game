I ran out of time, the cavern falling silent, the pillars looming like silent judges. Nothing appeared, only shock etched onto Namaru’s face.

The humming of the pillars intensified, morphing into a low, menacing drone. The light in the cavern began to dim, the water growing colder.

The light faded. The cavern fell silent, the pillars looming like silent judges. No crystal appeared.

Kalao: A valiant effort

His voice devoid with warmth

Namaru stepped forward, her face etched with sorrow. 

Namaru: The runes remain unsolved,

All of the 5 spirits: "You cannot return."

A cold current seized and pulled me downwards. I struggled against it, but the water was too strong. The surface, a distant memory, receded from view.

Darkness closed in.
